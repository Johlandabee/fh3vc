# Forza Horizon 3 Volume Control

**A little tool to control Forza's volume on PC**  
I was mighty annoyed by the fact, that you can't control Forza's volume via the Windows audio mixer.  
So I created this little tool.  

## Will this get me banned? How does it work?  
No, this tool will certainly **not cause a ban**. It does not modify the games memory or files.   
All it actually does is grabbing Forza's audio session via the windows Core Audio APIs.
