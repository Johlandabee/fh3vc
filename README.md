# Forza Horizon 3 Volume Control
A little tool to control Forza's volume on PC

# Will this get me banned? How does it work?
No, this tool will certainly not cause a ban. It does not modify the games memory or files.
All it actually does is grabbing Forza's audio session via the windows Core Audio APIs.
